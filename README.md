# Data and analysis for the dead_raccoons website

 I created the website ["How close has your child been to a dead raccoon?"](https://adiel3.github.io/dead_raccoons/) as my second project for Lede 2024. This is the data analysis repository for the project. The website repository can be found [here.][(https://github.com/adiel3/dead_raccoons](https://github.com/adiel3/dead_raccoons)
 
## The data
I wanted to practice my spatial analysis skills in QGIS, so I chose a dataset with geolocated points in a city with lots of open data maps. 

I had seen reports of dead raccoons during my first project looking for weird animal incidents. There were a lot. And I decided to try to overlay those points with interesting polygon data.

## The analysis
 From city public data, I extracted datasets of all reported dead raccoons since 2021, confirmed dead raccoons since 2021 and public elementary school locations.

 I then combined those using spatial analysis tools to see how many reported dead raccoons were in a child's walking distance of each elementary school and which neighborhoods
 had the highest number of schools with many raccoons within that range. 

 This took many steps of QGIS analysis, and I learned a lot doing it. While a silly topic, it was a worthwhile endeavor to practice these skills. 
 
## The presentation
 This was my first time taking a large set of layers and moving them from QGIS to Adobe Illustrator then through ai2html into a webpage. I made many mistakes and had
 to repeat a number of things. Once again, I learned a lot and was overall satisfied with the final version of the site, though there were definietly things I would do differently next time.

### A note
On initial commit of this project, the github hosted website was taking a very long time to finish uploading and was not yet functioning.
